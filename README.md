# A simple guide to Mini FRC software
# Step 1 - Downloading Driver Station Software
Download and run the latest version of [Alfredo Connect Desktop.](https://github.com/AlfredoElectronics/AlfredoConnect-Desktop/releases)
# Step 2 - Downloading Arduino Libraries
Download the Arduino Library for [Alfredo Connect Reciever](https://github.com/AlfredoElectronics/AlfredoConnect-Receive/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

In the Arduino IDE, Click `Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Add .ZIP Library...`, and select the ZIP file you downloaded.

Download the Arduino Library for the [motor shield](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-Shield-library/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

In the Arduino IDE, Click `Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Add .ZIP Library...`, and select the ZIP file you downloaded.

# Step 3 - Drivetrain Code
In the Arduino IDE, go to `File` > `Examples` > `AlfredoConnect-Receive-Master` > `Uno` > `Adafruit-Motor-Shield-v1` > `ArcadeBotGamepadUno`
This will pull up code for a two motor drive train.
